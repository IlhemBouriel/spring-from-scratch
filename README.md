# Get Started Project

we want to develop a web site using the following technology stack: HTML/JS pages as UI, Spring as a core server-side framework and Hibernate to interact with the data layer. We also want to use Maven to build and organize our project.  <br />
ML algorithm used is Logistic Regression <br />
## Installation

git clone https://github.com/IlhemBouriel/spring-from-scratch.git <br />
cd spring-from-scratch<br />
mvn clean install<br/>
mvn tomcat7:run<br/>
after deploying we got the message "INFOS: Starting ProtocolHandler ["http-bio-9090"]"</br>
So the app is started on port 9090  and our application will be available by the link:
http://localhost:9090/books
